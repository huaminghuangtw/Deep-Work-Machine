## Mantras

From Marty Fabrikant, as quoted in _The Knowledge_:

### 1. Talent Is Bullsh*t

> _‚ÄúI've seen a million writers with talent. It means nothing. You need guts, you need stick-to-it-iveness. It's work, you gotta work, do the freakin' work. That's why you're gonna make it, son. You work. No one can take that away from you.‚Äù_

### 2. The Work Is Everything

> _‚ÄúAnd I'll tell you something else. Appreciate these days. These days when you're broke and struggling, they're the best days of your life. You're gonna break through, my boy, and when you do, you'll look back on this time and think this is when I was really an artist, when everything was pure and I had nothing but the dream and the work. Enjoy it now. Pay attention. These are the good days. Be grateful for them.‚Äù_

## About

> _‚ÄúHappiness doesn't always make us feel happy. Living up to our values, challenging ourselves, facing our mistakes, depriving ourselves‚Ä¶ these aims make our lives happier, but they don't always make us feel happy in the moment.‚Äù ‚Äî Gretchen Rubin_

[Deep Work Machine](https://huami.ng/deep-work-machine) is a personal productivity system that I use every single day. I track my progress and score myself using two key metrics:

1. **Number of words written** ‚Äî Based on the [`.obsidian/vault-stats.json`](https://github.com/huaminghuangtw/Second-Brain/blob/main/.obsidian/vault-stats.json) file generated by the [Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count) plugin in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This file aggregates the total word count across all notes, providing an accurate measure of my writing output‚Äîsince all my writing is done in Obsidian.
2. **Number of [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) sessions completed** ‚Äî Recorded by the [‚ÄúLog Today's Flow Counts‚Äù](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/getting-things-done/log-todays-flow-counts/) Ô£ø Apple Shortcut, which logs each completed focus session ([‚Äúflow‚Äù](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202)) to a plain text file.

Inspired by [Cal Newport's book _Deep Work_](https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/), I developed a structured routine that includes both a [boot-up](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/getting-things-done/boot-up-sequence/) and [shut-down sequence](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/getting-things-done/shut-down-sequence/). Each time I begin a deep work session, I launch the [‚ÄúDeep Work Machine‚Äù](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/getting-things-done/deep-work-machine/), an Ô£ø Apple Shortcut that automatically initiates my essential workflows‚Äî[opening my journal in Obsidian](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/journaling/view-journal/), [reviewing today's schedule in Calendar](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/getting-things-done/plan-my-day/), [confirming my task list in Reminders](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/getting-things-done/view-todays-tasks/), [etc.](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/getting-things-done/deep-work-session/) This process takes about 2‚Äì3 minutes and prepares my mind for deep work bouts.

Next, the shortcut prompts me with [a thought-provoking question](https://huami.ng/lists/journal-prompt/#on-productivity) to clarify my main objective before fully committing to the next 30 minutes of focused work. Why? Because [what you work on is far more important than how productively you work](https://huami.ng/notes/what-you-work-on-is-far-more-important-than-how-productively-you-work/).

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <sub>Before each deep work session, I pause, close my eyes, and reflect on what I truly want to accomplish in the next 30 minutes.</sub> |

</p>

Once ready, the shortcut plays [30 minutes of 40-Hz binaural beats](https://youtu.be/1_G60OdEzXs), a frequency that [has been shown in studies](https://youtu.be/CQlTmOFM4Qs?t=1h11m34s) to enhance working memory and cognitive performance. After each session, I take a 5‚Äì10 minute break to deliberately defocus and let my mind wander.

The alternation between periods of intense concentration and intentional relaxation has strengthened my ‚Äúfocus muscle‚Äù and dramatically extended my attention span while being [indistractable](https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/).

Since 2023, I've consistently trained myself to follow this **[sprint-rest rhythm](https://huami.ng/notes/work-in-sprints-work-with-your-biology/)**, and can now easily enter a [flow state](https://huami.ng/notes/flow-state/), _wherever I am, whenever I want_.

When you're in ‚Äúthe zone,‚Äù you're fully immersed in the present moment. It's like [one-buttock playing](https://sketchplanations.com/one-buttock-playing), where you experience ‚Äútimeless time‚Äù and ‚Äúeffortless effort‚Äù‚Äîtime goes by so fast that hours can feel like just a few seconds, and you achieve your best work without even thinking about the clock.

Each day, my goal is to complete 6‚Äì8 ‚Äúintervals‚Äù, typically organized into 2‚Äì3 laser-focused 90-minute sessions with 15‚Äì20 minute breaks in between. This approach aligns with [ultradian cycles](https://youtu.be/yb5zpo5WDG4?t=1575)‚Äîthe natural rise and fall of alertness in 90-minute cycles. **For me, reaching this milestone marks a perfect day‚Äîone I'm genuinely grateful to celebrate, with nothing more to wish for.**

> _‚ÄúProductivity isn't really about getting more things done, it's mostly about learning to enjoy the journey ‚Äî because when we're having fun with things we're doing, then productivity takes care of itself.‚Äù ‚Äî Ali Abdaal_

By gamifying the process, [work feels like play to me](https://x.com/naval/status/1337144251403014144)‚Äîand I love this game, because my only competitor is the person I was yesterday.

As the saying goes, ‚ÄúDiscipline is the highest form of self-love.‚Äù Practicing this discipline has made me more productive, and more importantly, brought a profound sense of purpose and fulfillment to my creative work. It's rewarding. Like [Cal Newport said](https://calnewport.com/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/), ‚ÄúA working life dedicated to deep work is a working life well-lived.‚Äù
